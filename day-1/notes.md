### I learnt the basic architecture of kubernetes and the basic componets of a kubernetes.

### Exploxed a high level features of k8s and the advantages it provides

### On the control plane where the master nodes lives we have the api serever, scheduler, controller manager and etcd

### on the data plane where the worker nodes lives, we have mainly the kubelet and kubeproxy 

### kubelet and kubeproxy are on every node in the cluster both master and worker nodes.
