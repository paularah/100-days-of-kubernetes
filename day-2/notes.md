### Learnt about the kubeconfig file and its underlying components like User, Cluster and Context. Spun up a production cluster with k3s and explored the different kubectl commands. Explored tools for spinning up development grade clusters. Minicube, K3d and kind. 
### The production grade clusters were bootsrapped inside a ubuntu VM provisoined and managed by vagrant. Virtulisation with vagrant feels very much like containerisation, I guesss that why people often tend to confuse them for eac other.
